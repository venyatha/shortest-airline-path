This week, we focused on planning our project and setting up the files that we needed for our git repository.
We wrote up our team contract, decided on our project goals, and came up with a tentative timeline. In short, 
we want our project to use breadth-first traversal, implement Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm, and landmark 
path in order to find the shortest airline routes from a source to a destination with a given transit airport.
We also added our Makefile.

During our second meeting on Zoom, we roughly created the classes we needed to implement.
Using the LiveShare extension on VSCode, we collaboratively did the following-
We imported the OpenFlights dataset into data.txt, where we have data for the airlines. We then worked on
readFromFile.cpp, where we implemented the file to vector method and then called the function in main.cpp.
We also created a test for this method in tests.cpp, where our test case passed. After, we implemented the 
extracting required info method and called the function in main. We also created a test case for this method
in tests.cpp. We were not able to get our test to pass for a while, but we were finally able to fix it and 
now the two methods in readFromFile.cpp work. Then we added the catch folder where created catch.hpp and 
catchmain.cpp. Our tests are located in a tests folder, and for each of our tests we use a small sample
size for the test. Then we moved our contracts pdfs to the contracts folder.
