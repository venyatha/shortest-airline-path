Final Project

The purpose of our program is to find the shortest airplane paths between two cities, possibly with a stop in 
between. We got our data from https://openflights.org/data.html, where we used the routes database. Instead of
using all of the data, we decided to use a smaller sample. By using an adccurate smaller sample size, we are assuming
this implementation will work with all cities. This project is very useful in the real world, as it is very important for airlines to use the shortest path possible between two ciites.
